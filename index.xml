/BLOGDOWN-BODY-BEFORE --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout my graduate studies, I’ve used R quite a bit and have grown fond of it. When it comes to doing data science and machine learning, R fits the bill nicely. Not to mention R has a huge following and is currently one of the most popular languages in the world. As a result, it has a very active community and a huge selection of packages that pretty much allows R to do anything you want like reproducible reporting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the key skills of a data scientist is to communicate and share your analyses/models with your peers or stakeholders. If you can’t effectively show what you did, then what’s the point? The guys at RStudio have created a great solution called R Markdown. If you’ve ever used Markdown, then you know how easy it is. R Markdown allows one to embed R code into a reporting document. Just start a new .Rmd file in RStudio and adjust the YAML front matter at the very top of the document and you’re good to go. R Markdown borrows the syntax from vanilla Markdown where most of the difference is in parameterizing the code chunks. R Markdown is amazing for reproducibility. Also, anyone that’s ever seen a R Markdown document knows it’s one of the prettier looking documents. R Markdown even has the capability to embed Shiny apps/interactive widgets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there is one drawback to R Markdown right now and that’s blogging. In an ideal world, I would be in RStudio, writing a post in R Markdown and pushing it to github pages and be done with it. But it’s not there yet. I’ve seen many solutions from using Jekyll (which I haven’t found to be easy) to spinning up your own AWS EC2 instance and setting up a blog there to host html files. Most seem like more work than it should be just to put up a nice looking R Markdown page. After much searching around, I found &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown&#34;&gt;blogdown&lt;/a&gt; by Yihui Xie, the man who created Knitr. Blogdown uses &lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io/&#34;&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt;, a blogging framework for static pages built using the &lt;a href=&#34;https://golang.org/&#34;&gt;Go&lt;/a&gt; language. One word of warning, blogdown is still under development, but I’ve tested it out and there have been minor issues, but most of it is because there is no documentation right now if you’re stuck. I’ve had to go under the hood and look at the code to figure out what functions to run. Below I’ll show a quick way to get set up so that blogging with R Markdown is joy from start to finish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assuming you already have R/RStudio installed, you’ll need to download the blogdown package to your machine like so:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;devtools::install_github(&amp;#39;rstudio/blogdown&amp;#39;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, you’ll need to install Hugo to your local machine using the blogdown function &lt;code&gt;install_hugo()&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;blogdown::install_hugo()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, we can create a new directory for our webpage and make sure to set your working directory to that new directory. Once in your empty directory, run the following command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;blogdown::new_site()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the above does not work, make sure you are creating a completely empty directory. I ran into a few issues when I tried to run the above function on a directory with a .Rproj file in it. So remember, the directory will need to be &lt;em&gt;totally empty&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above command will generate all the necessary skeleton files needed to generate the blog and launch it in the console. It will also show a preview of your blog in the viewer window in RStudio. The above command also automatically downloads a theme, but this can easily be changed if you choose with the below command. You can find more Hugo themes at &lt;a href=&#34;themes.gohugo.io&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. My current theme is academic. You can change it to whatever you want by specifying the github repo and the theme name as shown below in quotes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;blogdown::install_theme(&amp;#39;gcushen/hugo-academic&amp;#39;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind when you install a new theme, the config file &lt;code&gt;config.toml&lt;/code&gt; will update to use the most recently downloaded theme as default. So to change it in the future just go into the &lt;code&gt;config.toml&lt;/code&gt; file and adjust the &lt;code&gt;theme =&lt;/code&gt; parameter to the name of the theme you want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you’re happy with the theme, it’s good practice to preview your blog before pushing it out to the world. Run the following in your console:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;blogdown::serve_site()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will generate the blog and preview it on your local machine. Blogdown loads your website on your localhost IP address. Mine shows up here: &lt;code&gt;http://127.0.0.1:4321/&lt;/code&gt;. If you’re using RStudio, you’ll be able to preview the site/post and make changes on the fly. When you make changes to the R Markdown document being previewed, blogdown will rebuild the website when you hit save and the Viewer in RStudio will automatically show the updated content. You can also use &lt;code&gt;blogdown::build_site()&lt;/code&gt; to build the site for publishing, but it will not preview it. Hugo generates the published content in the &lt;code&gt;public/&lt;/code&gt; directory of your root.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you create a new Rmd file in RStudio, a date will automatically be propogated for you in the &lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;December 5, 2016&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; format in the YAML front matter. Hugo will not be able to correctly parse this date when it builds the website and will throw an error. So make sure to manually change the date to this format &lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;2016-12-06&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you followed those basic steps then you should have the website files in the &lt;code&gt;public/&lt;/code&gt; directory and you’re good to go. I won’t show you how to put your blog posts online as everyone has their preference for blogging platform. I personally use github pages because it’s free and having version control with your blog posts is nice. Blogdown is a good complement because I don’t have to worry converting &lt;code&gt;.Rmd&lt;/code&gt; files to &lt;code&gt;.md&lt;/code&gt; files and put plot figures in separate folders; it’s all done for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember, blogdown is still under development so many people are bound to run into errors and the lack of documentation doesn’t help. To their credit, the RStudio guys are busy making our lives better. Blogdown is a great start to easy blogging in R Markdown. And I look forward to more developments coming to this package.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope this post helped some of you out there like me who love R Markdown and want to easily share these type of documents. Happy R Markdown blogging!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>First Post using Hugo</title>
      <link>http://kevinfw.com/post/first-post-using-hugo/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve used many different frameworks and platforms for blogging from Blogspot to Wordpress to Ghost to Jekyll. R Markdown is awesome, but it&amp;rsquo;s never been easy to share R Markdown documents on any of those platforms. Hugo is another blogging framework, which I&amp;rsquo;ve heard great things about. It compiles very quickly and has little dependencies to worry about compared to Jekyll. I&amp;rsquo;m going to give it a try and hopefully it will play nicely with R Markdown. Looking forward to the adventure! Stay tuned.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>MSPA Review and the Data Science Path</title>
      <link>http://kevinfw.com/post/mspa-review-and-path-to-data-science/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 13 Sep 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://kevinfw.com/post/mspa-review-and-path-to-data-science/</guid>
      <description>&lt;!-- BLOGDOWN-BODY-BEFORE

/BLOGDOWN-BODY-BEFORE --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most interesting things about data science is the diversity of practitioners’ backgrounds. I’ve met people who are very science-y (Physics, Astronomy) to very technical (Computer Science, Mathematics) to very business-y (Marketing, IT). There is no definitive path to data science aside from getting a MS or PhD in Statistics or Computer Science since data science involves statistics and software development skills. It’s the most interesting field currently with lots of freedom to explore, to build, to learn, and to shape the future. It’s a very exciting time for data science applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everytime I meet people and tell them that I’m a graduate student in predictive analytics at Northwestern University, a lot of people always ask me how I like the program. The short answer is that it’s a great program. You learn the necessary math (linear algebra, statistics, probability), programming languages (R, Python, SAS), and applications (data cleaning, statistical analysis, machine learning, data visualization) to be a contender for data science jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another question I get asked often is, “Is a degree necessary to get into data science?” Honestly, I don’t think I’m qualified to answer that since I’m a student and am looking for a job myself, but my personal belief is that I prefer getting a degree over certifications from MOOCs because of the structure it enforces. MOOCs and self-taught courses have too little structure and accountability in my opinion. I know lots of people want to get into the fast lane into data science, but the honest truth is it takes time, work, and thought. Something that just can’t be mastered in a two month bootcamp. Obviously, a lot of this largely depends on your background, your natural abilities, and how you put yourself out there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there is always a disclaimer, something I learned over the past year, that I give people and that’s having a degree in something doesn’t guarantee anything. The degree gets you half way there, the other half relies on your ability to share your work, network with others, and be persistent in improving yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been a part of the MSPA program for a little over a year now and I am 75% done (9/12 courses through). I’ll go over in little detail of each category I feel is important to making that choice to pursue the degree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;reputation&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Reputation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Northwestern University is a top notch institution. There are lots of universities offering data science degrees, but not many with NU’s reputation of world class education. Northwestern University was actually one of the first institutions to offer a degree in analytics (online), so that says a lot about their understanding of the field. They are constantly refining the course offerings to match the skills needed for a modern data scientist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;faculty&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Faculty&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professors are for the most part great. They each have a wealth of experience in the field and are experts in their field. Some are better than others, but that’s just normal variation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;courses&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Courses&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This subject probably matters the most to people. In the program, you will learn math, specifically linear algebra, probability, statistics, and calculus. You will also learn theory that’s necessary for you to be an effective practitioner of analytics. So expect topics like data cleaning, statistical analysis, and machine learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will learn about the popular programming languages–R, Python, SAS. But likely, you won’t master them in this program. However, you will be challenged to at least become proficient. There are usually lots of extra material to expand your abilities in whatever language is used in the course and you will learn a lot from professors and peers, who may know more programming than you do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The courses will challenge you and teach you to be a practitioner of data science. However, don’t expect to become an expert in mathematical theory. You will understand just enough to get the job done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;network&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Network&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found that students in all my classes have always been very active, very friendly, and very intelligent. There is a very strong network of students/alumnis of the program on LinkedIn. Everyone is friendly and always willing to give advice. For many, the LinkedIn groups are the central hub of the MSPA program. You will find a lot of guidance and questions answered there. There is also a career center, but be prepared to take the initiative. You won’t get any help if you don’t ask for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;value&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Value&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, the price is on the higher end. Currently, the cost of one course is just north of $4k. The total required courses to complete the degree is 12. So do the math and you get a grand total of about $48k. There are others that are more expensive like Berkeley’s master in data science which costs about $60k last time I checked. There are a few other various degree programs out there that costs less than $20k. And obviously, there are bootcamps that are even cheaper (less than $10k) with guarantees to get you a job, although I’ve met people in these bootcamps that mention it’s not as great as it sounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So overall, you’ll learn a lot. You will be able to do data science after this program. You will become qualified for an entry data science job. But remember, whatever your path to get there, it’s the little details that matter like having a github page that showcases your code or going to a meetup and talking to people about data science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
